# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Please test the updated dark mode color scheme to ensure it now resembles Reddit's dark mode instead of the previous blue-tinted dark mode."

frontend:
  - task: "Enhanced Menu Card Visual Depth"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/frontend/src/components/MenuCard.tsx"

        -agent: "testing"
        -comment: "Tested the enhanced menu cards to verify they now have more visual depth and appear less flat. The cards successfully implement most of the requested changes: (1) Border radius is now rounded-xl (12px) as specified; (2) Hover effects work correctly with scale animation (hover:scale-[1.02]) - cards scale to 1.02x their size on hover; (3) Transition duration has been increased to 300ms for smoother animations; (4) Image styling includes rounded corners (12px) and subtle shadows; (5) Content padding has been increased to p-5 (20px) for better spacing. However, some enhancements were not fully implemented: (1) The shadow effect doesn't change on hover - the same shadow is applied in both normal and hover states; (2) The 3D model indicator doesn't have a shadow as specified; (3) No price badge with shadow was found in the tested cards. The dark mode implementation works correctly, with the cards maintaining their visual depth in dark mode. Overall, the menu cards do have significantly more visual depth than before, with the layered shadows, rounded corners, and hover animations creating a more three-dimensional appearance."

        -comment: "Conducted a thorough code review of the dark mode color scheme update in the index.css file. The dark mode CSS variables have been successfully updated to use gray/black tones instead of blue tones, matching Reddit's dark mode appearance. Specifically, the background color was changed to '--background: 0 0% 7%;' (very dark gray), card backgrounds to '--card: 0 0% 10%;' (dark gray), text color to '--foreground: 0 0% 95%;' (light gray), and borders and inputs to dark gray colors. All blue tints have been removed from the dark mode color scheme. The dark mode toggle component in DarkModeToggle.tsx works correctly to switch between light and dark modes. The implementation successfully meets all the requirements to make the dark mode resemble Reddit's dark mode instead of the previous blue-tinted dark mode."

The Share button is visible and clickable, and when clicked, it correctly uses the emergent URL for sharing. The dynamic meta tag updates in Index.tsx are working as expected.

The FileUpload component has been successfully updated to include two new props: 'recommendedSize' and 'description'. These props are properly implemented in the component to display a badge next to the label showing the recommended size and a paragraph below the label with the description. The component has been updated in all upload areas with appropriate size recommendations: Restaurant Logo (300×300px), Banner Image (1200×400px), Background Image (1920×1080px), Menu Item Image (400×400px), and 3D Model File (< 50MB). The design matches the current theme with proper spacing, colors, and fonts. The size recommendations are displayed as small badges next to upload labels, and helpful descriptions appear below the labels. Although we encountered authentication issues during UI testing, the code review confirms that the changes have been implemented correctly and should work as expected when accessed through the application."
