# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The GET /api/homepage/content endpoint returns the correct model structure with these base64 fields. One issue to note: when updating content with PUT /api/homepage/content, if you update only part of the hero object (e.g., just the headline and subheadline), the hero_image_base64 field will be lost.

However, some enhancements were not fully implemented: (1) The shadow effect doesn't change on hover - the same shadow is applied in both normal and hover states; (2) The 3D model indicator doesn't have a shadow as specified; (3) No price badge with shadow was found in the tested cards. The dark mode implementation works correctly, with the cards maintaining their visual depth in dark mode.

        -comment: "Conducted a thorough code review of the dark mode color scheme update in the index.css file. The dark mode CSS variables have been successfully updated to use gray/black tones instead of blue tones, matching Reddit's dark mode appearance. Specifically, the background color was changed to '--background: 0 0% 7%;' (very dark gray), card backgrounds to '--card: 0 0% 10%;' (dark gray), text color to '--foreground: 0 0% 95%;' (light gray), and borders and inputs to dark gray colors. All blue tints have been removed from the dark mode color scheme. The dark mode toggle component in DarkModeToggle.tsx works correctly to switch between light and dark modes. The implementation successfully meets all the requirements to make the dark mode resemble Reddit's dark mode instead of the previous blue-tinted dark mode."

The shareViaText function in shareMenu.ts uses REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL which is set to the emergent URL (https://8cfc14fa-3d1f-48a7-9665-4a606ed34105.preview.emergentagent.com) in the .env file. When clicked, the sharing mechanism is triggered. Due to browser limitations in the testing environment, we couldn't directly verify the Web Share API or SMS fallback, but based on code review, the implementation correctly uses the emergent URL for sharing."

All meta tags are properly set with restaurant menu content instead of Lovable branding. The OG URL meta tag has the correct emergent URL (https://8cfc14fa-3d1f-48a7-9665-4a606ed34105.preview.emergentagent.com). The OG Image meta tag uses a restaurant image (https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1414235077428-338989a2e8c0) instead of Lovable branding. The Share button is visible and clickable, and when clicked, it correctly uses the emergent URL for sharing. The dynamic meta tag updates in Index.tsx are working as expected. Only minor issue: the canonical URL has a trailing slash that doesn't match exactly with the OG URL."

        -comment: "Conducted a code review of the enhanced FileUpload component and its implementation in various upload areas. The FileUpload component has been successfully updated to include two new props: 'recommendedSize' and 'description'. These props are properly implemented in the component to display a badge next to the label showing the recommended size and a paragraph below the label with the description. The component has been updated in all upload areas with appropriate size recommendations: Restaurant Logo (300×300px), Banner Image (1200×400px), Background Image (1920×1080px), Menu Item Image (400×400px), and 3D Model File (< 50MB). The design matches the current theme with proper spacing, colors, and fonts. The size recommendations are displayed as small badges next to upload labels, and helpful descriptions appear below the labels. Although we encountered authentication issues during UI testing, the code review confirms that the changes have been implemented correctly and should work as expected when accessed through the application."

Implementation includes: 1) Added SparkJS and Three.js import map to HTML head for CDN loading, 2) Created comprehensive SplatViewer React component with full Three.js integration, 3) Support for .splat file loading and rendering with proper error handling, 4) Fallback 3D geometry (sphere/cube) when no splat file is provided, 5) Auto-rotation animation and dark theme styling to match overall design, 6) Loading states and error handling with user-friendly messages, 7) Updated hero section to display 3D viewer instead of static images, 8) Enhanced backend upload endpoint to detect and properly handle .splat files with special MIME type (application/splat), 9) Updated homepage editor to show 3D preview with splat file upload instructions, 10) Admin overlay for easy .splat file uploading. The hero section now displays an interactive 3D viewer that can showcase Gaussian Splatting models, providing an immersive preview of the restaurant's 3D food technology."

    -message: "I've completed testing of the backend API endpoints for the updated TAST3D homepage implementation. All backend tests are now passing. The new upload endpoints (POST /api/homepage/upload/hero and POST /api/homepage/upload/demo/{index}) are working correctly, accepting file uploads, converting them to base64, and storing them in the database. The updated model schema with base64 fields instead of URLs is also working correctly. The GET /api/homepage/content endpoint returns the correct structure with hero_image_base64 and image_base64 fields. The default features have been updated to include exactly 3 items as required. There are two minor issues to note: 1) When updating content with PUT /api/homepage/content, if you update only part of the hero object, the hero_image_base64 field will be lost - to preserve it, it must be included in the update payload; 2) When providing an invalid index for the demo image upload endpoint, it returns a 500 error instead of a 400 error, but the error message correctly indicates that the index must be between 0 and 2. These are minor issues that don't affect the core functionality."

    -message: "I've completed comprehensive testing of all backend API endpoints for the SparkJS homepage implementation. All tests are passing successfully. The backend properly supports the new SparkJS optimization features and maintains compatibility with the existing 3D model upload/serving functionality. Key findings: 1) The homepage content API endpoints (GET/PUT /api/homepage/content) work correctly, 2) File upload endpoints for both hero images and demo images function properly, 3) The file serving endpoint correctly serves uploaded files with proper content types, 4) 3D model files (.ply and .splat) are handled correctly with appropriate MIME types, 5) File size limits (200MB for hero uploads) are enforced, 6) Error handling works correctly for invalid indices and missing files, 7) CORS headers are properly set for cross-origin requests. The backend is fully functional and ready to support the frontend SparkJS implementation."

    -message: "I've completed comprehensive testing of the backend API for the simplified PlayCanvas URL functionality on the homepage. All tests are passing successfully. Key findings: 1) GET /api/homepage/content correctly returns content with hero_image_base64 field, 2) PUT /api/homepage/content successfully stores PlayCanvas URLs (like 'https://playcanv.as/p/3585fc6e') in the hero_image_base64 field, 3) PlayCanvas URLs are stored and retrieved correctly without any validation restrictions, 4) URLs can be removed by setting hero_image_base64 to null, 5) Empty strings and invalid URL formats are accepted and stored as-is (no backend validation), 6) PlayCanvas URLs persist correctly across multiple operations, 7) The specific URL format from the review request ('https://playcanv.as/p/3585fc6e') works perfectly. The backend fully supports the simplified PlayCanvas approach where admins enter URLs instead of uploading files. The hero_image_base64 field effectively serves as a flexible storage for both file paths and PlayCanvas URLs. All 18 test cases passed, confirming the backend is ready for the PlayCanvas integration."
