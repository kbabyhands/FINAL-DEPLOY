The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned a restaurant menu MVP to a sophisticated homepage featuring 3D Gaussian Splatting. Initial work involved UI/UX refinements, extensive rebranding, and shifting from dark to light mode. A major pivot occurred with the -inspired homepage, integrating dynamic content management via FastAPI and an admin editor. The significant challenge was integrating 3D  and  models, leading to a critical architectural shift from MongoDB base64 storage to file system storage to overcome the 16MB MongoDB document limit. The engineer debugged persistent frontend  errors, backend file-serving issues, and optimized SparkJS integration for performance and mobile responsiveness. Most recently, the AI engineer has been meticulously resolving complex Git push failures due to large  files in the repository history, culminating in the successful application of WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history

The goal was to transform an MVP restaurant menu app into a professional, interactive platform. Initial requirements included branding (changing lovable to emergent), removing dark mode, updating favicons, and enhancing menu UI with  and . The project evolved to designing a dynamic homepage inspired by  and , emphasizing bold typography and structured content. Subsequent iterations demanded a carousel for the menu demo, a dark color scheme, detailed How It Works steps, image/link uploads for live demos, and a comprehensive admin editor. Crucially, the latest phase involved embedding an interactive 3D splat/PLY viewer with upload capabilities for hero and demo sections, restricted to admin users, and ensuring optimal performance and mobile responsiveness.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack React/FastAPI architecture with a MongoDB database.


-   : Main FastAPI entry point. Updated for file upload limits and to handle file serving by path instead of base64 data. Important for setting up  and  serving.
-   : Defines Pydantic models for homepage content. Updated to use  instead of  for file system storage and added .
-   : Handles homepage content CRUD and file uploads. Modified to save files to , store paths in MongoDB, and added  endpoint for serving files. Admin authentication was temporarily removed.
-   : The core homepage component. Underwent multiple redesigns, now integrates  for 3D models, an interactive menu demo carousel, and static content. It has been extensively refactored for mobile responsiveness and z-index management of background elements. An import error for  component was recently fixed.
-   : Admin interface for homepage content. Enhanced for uploading 3D models (PLY/Splat) and demo images, including progress bars.
-   : New component for 3D Gaussian Splatting and PLY model rendering. Initially used SparkJS via CDN/import maps, but transitioned to npm package (, , ) due to Vite compatibility issues. It now handles dynamic loading, error handling, auto-rotation, manual OrbitControls, model orientation (180Â° X-axis flip), and aggressive performance optimizations for faster loading and smoother rendering on Chrome and mobile. All complex rotation logic was simplified to a continuous slow Y-axis spin.
-   : Main HTML file. Cleaned from import maps.
-   : Global styles. Modified for dark theme, general aesthetics, and mobile responsiveness.
-   : Generic file upload component. Enhanced to accept specific file types and display size limits.
-   : Directory for uploaded 3D models and images.  was updated to exclude this directory and  files to address Git push issues.

<pending_tasks>
- **Reinstate Admin Authentication**: Admin authentication was removed from upload endpoints and needs to be properly re-implemented.
- **Persistent Git Push Issues**: The large PLY file in Git history is still causing issues. A WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer was intensely focused on resolving persistent Git push failures. The core problem was a large  file (, 136.40 MB) that exceeded GitHub's 100MB limit and was tracked in Git history, despite subsequent  updates. Multiple attempts were made:
1.  Adding  and  to .
2.  Using  to untrack the file (which failed because it was still in history).
3.  Resetting Git history to a previous commit and re-adding changes (also failed to fully resolve the history issue).
The AI engineer then leveraged support agent guidance and executed WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an
	 alternative filtering tool such as 'git filter-repo'
	 (https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) instead.  See the
	 filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
Proceeding with filter-branch... to rewrite the entire Git history and permanently remove the large file. This command was reported as successfully processing commits. The current state is that the Git history *should* be clean of the large file, and the next step involves cleaning up Git references and performing a force push to the remote repository. The application's frontend is fully mobile-responsive with a functional SparkJS 3D viewer, and prominent tech background elements are visible.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Clean up old Git references and force push the rewritten history to the remote repository.
